# Link Shortener App

This is a project I completed during a two-day sprint while studying at [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com). This app was built using the Node, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Angular, Bcrypt, Bower, Gulp, and Karma. The objective of this project was to architect and build a secure client-side in Angular. The link-shortening, user-experience, and server aspects of the project were secondary to the Angular client.
